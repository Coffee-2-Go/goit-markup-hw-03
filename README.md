## Acceptance criteria

### Project

`"A1"` In the root of the project there is an `images` folder with images.

`"A2"` At the root of the project there is a `css` folder with a style file.

`"A3"` All styles are written in one `styles.css` file, which is located in the `css` folder.

`"A4"` File names do not contain capital letters, spaces and transliteration. The names contain only English letters and words.

`"A5"` Source code formatted with `Prettier`.

`"A6"` All images and textual content are taken from the layout.

`"A7"` Connected style normalizer [modern-normalize](<https://cdnjs.com/libraries/modern-normalize>).

`"A8"` The code is written in accordance with the [**instructions**](https://codeguide.co/).

### Markup

`"B1"` Allows global style reset by tag selector for `<h1>...<h6>`, `<p>` and `<ul>` elements.

`"B2"` Elements do not have external indents (`margin` property) that "punch" the parent element.

`"B3"` The `margin` property is used for vertical indents between two adjacent elements.

`"B4"` The `padding` property is used for the space between the parent frame and its child.

`"B5"` The dimensions of external indents (`margin` property) and internal fields (`padding` property) of the elements are set exactly according to the layout.

`"B6"` Created a generic auxiliary class `.container` for centering and limiting the width of the content.

`"B8"` The width of the "container" corresponds to the layout and is equal to `1158px`.

`"B9"` "Container" wraps the content of the header, footer and sections. That is, it is inside them.

`"B10"` `Flexbox` is used to position elements, but only where necessary. For example, in the header, navigation, lists in sections, etc., that is, where it is impossible to arrange elements horizontally in any other way.

`"B11"` The final sizes of the blocks in the browser correspond to the layout.

`"B12"` Elements do not have a fixed height, it is determined by their content.

`"B13"` The header has a bottom frame, you need to zoom in a lot to see it.

`"B14"` Sections are arranged one under the other like a stack of books, without external indents.

`"B15"` For all sections, one `.section` class is used, which is given upper and lower paddings of `120px`, which push the content inside the section.

`"B16"` `Our Portfolio` section cards have a border (`border` property), but only at the bottom of the card.
